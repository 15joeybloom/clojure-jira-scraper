## Instructions

First, make a JIRA API token. https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens might help.

Define env vars:

    JIRA_EMAIL
    JIRA_TOKEN
    JIRA_ORG

Example: find some random tickets.

    lein run "'Epic Link' = PDQ"
    lein run "project = XYZ AND status = Backlog" | shuf | tail > stuff.csv && open stuff.csv
